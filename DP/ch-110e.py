# Description:
# You and a friend are working on a very important, bleeding-edge, research paper:
# "Computational Complexity of Sorting Pictures of Cats with Funny Text on the Web".
# The catch though is your friend wrote his part of the paper with his hands shifted
# to the right, meaning the top row of keys he used weren't "QWERTYUIOP" (regular US keyboard),
# but instead "WERTYUIOP{".
# Your goal is to take what your friend wrote, and convert it from his broken
# shifted text back into regular english!

# Formal Inputs & Outputs:

# Input Description:
# String ShiftedText - The shifted text in question. The only chracters you have to deal with
# are letters, in both cases, and the following symbols: '{', '[', ':', ';', '<', ','. The
# space character may be present, but you do not have to shift that.

# Output Description:
# Print the correct text.

# Sample Inputs & Outputs:
# The string "Jr;;p ept;f" should shift back, through your function, into "Hello World". 
# Another example is: "Lmiyj od ,u jrtp", which corrects to "Knuth is my hero"


# Recursive Solution

normal = "QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNMqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm"

	unshifted = ""
	for i in text:
		if i == " ":
			unshifted += " "
		else:
			unshifted += normal[shifted.find(i)]
	return unshifted

text1 = "Lmiyj od ,u jrtp"
print unshift(text1)

text2 = "Jr;;p ept;f"
