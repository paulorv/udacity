# Guess-That-Number Game
#
# *Description*
# 
# A "guess-that-number" game is exactly what it sounds like: a number is guessed 
# at random by the computer, and you must guess that number to win! The only 
# thing the computer tells you is if your guess is below or above the number.
# Your goal is to write a program that, upon initialization, guesses a number 
# between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and asks you for your guess. If you type a 
# number, the program must either tell you if you won (you guessed the computer's 
# number), or if your guess was below the computer's number, or if your guess 
# was above the computer's number. If the user ever types "exit", the program 
# must terminate.
#
# *Formal Inputs & Outputs*
#
# Input Description:
# At run-time, expect the user to input a number from 1 to 100 (inclusive), or 
# the string "exit", and treat all other conditions as a wrong guess.
#
# Output Description:
# The program must print whether or not your guess was correct, otherwise print 
# if your guess was below or above the computer's number.
#
# Sample Inputs & Outputs:
# Let "C>" be the output from your applicatgion, and "U>" be what the user types:
# C> Welcome to guess-that-numbers game! I have already picked a number in [1, 100]. 
# Please make a guess. Type "exit" to quit.
# U> 1
# C> Wrong. That number is below my number.
# U> 50
# C> Wrong. That number is above my number.
# ...
# U> 31
# C> Correct! That is my number, you win! <Program terminates>
